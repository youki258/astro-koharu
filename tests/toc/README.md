# TOC regression tests

Run against an Astro development server:

```sh
pnpm exec astro dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4353
TOC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4353 pnpm exec playwright test -c tests/toc/playwright.config.ts
```

Without `TOC_BASE_URL`, Playwright starts a server at port 4353. Artifacts default to `/tmp/astro-koharu-toc-results`.
Chromium and WebKit cover repeated touch opening at 320px/390px portrait and 844px landscape, per-frame opacity and
clip-path completion, current-heading focus, stable article position, dismissal and reduced motion.
The desktop case checks keyboard opening, focus restoration and switching back to the sidebar TOC.
Sidebar cases sample the ribbon against still-visible children throughout chapter collapse, including an interrupted
collapse that reverses into expansion. Reduced motion checks immediate folding and the current marker's final position.
These are browser-emulated viewports, not physical-device verification.
